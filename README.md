soooooo back at it...this is the last project before I finish Intermediate HTML + CSS! i feel like i've learned a lot-but i'm just happy i FINALLY learned grid. i think i like flex a little more, but i feel like grid is more handy, i just need to get more used to it. school started so i haven't been on my TOP grind, but i know like 1000% i've improved a lot. like even this project, i know i might get stuck in some places but i didn't doubt for a sec i couldn't finish it or anything, which is definitely great! anyways im excited so yayy i finished the sidebar today, so im just gonna split into the header and main-content.
